It is not important that how much resources you have, than how
feasible they are. Before the development of computer and internet
technology, printed version of resources like books, journals,
dictionaries, work books, etc played a significant role in teaching and
learning process. But these printed versions are not easily accessible
to all and are also expensive in nature. For example, if two teachers
want to refer to a particular book simultaneously, two separate copies
of the same book must be needed in the library. Instead of having the
printed version of the book, if we have electronic or e-version of the
book, the same book can be easily accessed simultaneously by many
and also can be accessed from their drawing room with the help of a
personal computer. Advances in computer applications during the past few decades have brought radical changes in the way information is gathered, store, organized, accessed, retrieved and consumed. The application of computers in information processing has brought several products and services to the scene. The Internet and the Web are constantly influencing the development of new modes of scholarly communication; their potential for delivering goods is quite vast, as they overcome successfully the geographical limitations associated with the print media. Further, the distribution time between product publication and its delivery has been drastically reduced. The Internet can be used for efficient retrieval and meeting information needs. This is very important for university libraries since most of them call for more and more research work. This important fact is convincing many libraries to move towards digital e-resources, which are found to be less expensive and more useful for easy access. This is especially helpful to distant learners who have limited time to access the libraries from outside by dial-up access to commonly available electronic resources, mainly CD-ROM, OPACs and Internet, which are replacing the print media.</font></p>
